## Create ERC20 Staking App using Thirdweb SDK

This app will allow users to stake a token and earn a reward token in return. We will cover deploying the necessary contracts for the ERC20 tokens and an ERC20 staking contract. We will then build our own staking application to allow a user to stake, unstake, and claim their reward tokens.   

## Demo

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `pages/_app.tsx`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app, this is necessary for our [hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) and
[UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components) to work.

### Deploy to IPFS

Deploy a copy of your application to IPFS using the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy
```
